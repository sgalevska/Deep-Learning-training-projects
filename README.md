# Deep-Learning-training-projects
Training projects for Deep Learning course at the Master Degree of Data Science, UNIPD

I worked on these assignements as part of my master course in Deep Learning. They cover broad topics starting from Deep Feedforward Networks; 
Optimization for training Deep Models; Convolutional Neural Networks; Recurrent Neural Networks for sequence modelling; Recursive Neural Networks for Trees and Graphs
Autoencoders; Deep Generative Models. Mostly using tensorflow.
